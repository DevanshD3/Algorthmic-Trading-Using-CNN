# Algorthmic-Trading-Using-CNN
This project is essentially the implementation of the paper “Algorithmic Financial Trading with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks: Time Series to Image Conversion Approach” .
Here is the link to the paper: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324802031_Algorithmic_Financial_Trading_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_Time_Series_to_Image_Conversion_Approach

The idea is to make a trading system which buys, sells or holds the stock based on a list of technical indicators. These technical indicators shall be fed to a CNN in the form of images to generate labels.

Pre Requisites include basic Python knowledge and a grasp of how financial markets work. Besides this, you should be keen to implement simple Deep Learning algorithms using Tensorflow.
